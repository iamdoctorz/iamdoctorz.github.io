<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I received my Ph.D. at China University of Geosciences, Beijing (CUGB) in 2017. In 2015-2017, I also worked as a guest scientist in the GeoForschung Zentrum (GFZ) 1280HR SIMS lab in Potsdam, Germany.
My postdoctoral research work in years 2017-2020 at Arizona State University (ASU) focused on the study of water and hydrogen isotopic compositions in anhydrous minerals from the asteroid Itokawa and ordinary chondrites using the NanoSIMS 50L. 
In 2021, I joined the State Key Lab of Lunar and Planetary Science at Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an Assistant Professor.</p>
